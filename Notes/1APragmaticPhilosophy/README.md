# A Pragmatic Philosophy

- I can become a better developer and help others become better as well.
- I can become a Pragmatic Programmer.
- The Pragmatic programmer, it's an attitude, a style, a philoshopy of approaching problems and their solutions.
- The Pragmatic Programmer take the responsibility for everything they do.
- We examine a plan to create change and share risks of slow changes.
- Sometime near-perfection is the only option, but often there are trade=offs involved.
- Learning is a continuous and ongoing process, and we need strategies to keeping the momentum up.
- We all spend a large acoumt of time interacting with others.
